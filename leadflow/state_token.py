"""Tamper-proof tokens for the paused graph state.

Human-in-the-loop here is stateless: when the graph pauses, the server has nothing stored, so the paused state
travels to the browser and back. If the server trusted the state the browser sends back, a user could edit it
(e.g. swap in a reply that never went through the reply check) and the graph would continue from the edited state.

So the server sends the state inside a signed token: base64(zlib(json)) + "." + HMAC-SHA256(body, secret key).
On resume it recomputes the HMAC. A token that was changed, or signed with another key, is rejected.
The token is signed, not encrypted: whoever holds it can read the state (it's their own data) but can't change it.
